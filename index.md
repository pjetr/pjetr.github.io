Hi, My name is Peter Delvaux. I'm a 33 year old full-stack developer from Belgium.<br>
I've been thinking of starting a new blog or whatever for quite some time now, and now that I wanted to learn myself to work with Vue, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity.<br>
So come join me on my quest, and <em><strong>L</strong>earn <strong>V</strong>ue <strong>W</strong>ith <strong>M</strong>e</em>.
</p>

Now I won't make any promises, but I'll try to add a new post weekly to open series.
